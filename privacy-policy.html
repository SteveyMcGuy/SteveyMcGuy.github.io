This privacy policy does not apply to the collection, use or disclosure of information through any apps for which SteveyMcGuy is not the publisher. By installing the apps on your mobile device, entering into, connecting to, accessing and/or using the apps, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this privacy policy, including to the possible collection and processing of your information and you are consenting to the use of cookies and other tracking technologies on your device. please note: if you or, as applicable, your legal guardian, disagree to any term provided herein, you may not install, access and/or use the apps and you are requested to promptly erase them, and any part thereof, from your mobile device.

				<h2 id="changes">2. Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
				<p>
					We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy. Privacy Policy will indicate the date it was last updated. Your continued use of our apps will signify your acceptance of the changes to our Privacy Policy. 
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2 id="what-information-we-collect">3. What information we collect</h2>
				<p>
					SteveyMcGuy is a small home based app provider that does not collect any information about its users. We do not collect any personal information about you. &#39;Personal Information&#39; means personally identifiable information, such as your physical address, calendar entries, contact entries, files, photos, etc.
					We do not have any registration system, we do not collect your email address, we have no access to your photos video, audio, physical location or IP address. <br><br>
					SteveyMcGuy does not use or share information about its users as no information is collected.
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2 id="childrens-use">4. Children&#39;s Use of the Platforms.</h2>
				<p>
					SteveyMcGuy has developed its apps to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages. Whenever we refer to children in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under the age of 13, unless otherwise indicated.
					SteveyMcGuy complies with the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children. SteveyMcGuy takes precautions designed to protect the online privacy of children, and we encourage parents to take an active role in protecting their children&#39;s privacy by discussing this Privacy Policy with them.
					SteveyMcGuy does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by COPPA from children (or adults) through its apps. If we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal information from a child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it. 
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2 id="links">5. Links.</h2>
				<p>
					If you click on a link to a website, platform, or service not controlled by us, including on an advertisement or an ad provider link, you will leave the SteveyMcGuy App you are visiting and go to the site you selected. These other entities may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit information from you. Because we cannot control the activities of other entities, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your information by such entities, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as SteveyMcGuy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these other entities from whom you request services. If you visit a website, platform, or service that is linked to on a Budge Studios Platform, you should consult that site&#39;s privacy policy before providing any information on that site.

				<h2 id="third-party">6. Third-party websites and services</h2>
				<p>
					The Apps are developed using Unity and include Unity Ads. The apps may contain links to third-party advertisements through Unity Ads. If you choose to click through to one of these other websites or online services, please note that any information you may provide will be subject to the privacy policy and other terms and conditions of that websites or service, and not to this Privacy Policy. We do not control third-party websites or services, and the fact that a link to such a website or service appears in the Apps does not mean that we endorse them or have approved their policies or practices relating to user information. Before providing any information to any third-party website or service, we encourage you to review the privacy policy and other terms and conditions of that website or service. You agree that we will have no liability for any matters relating to a third-party website or service that you provide information to, including their collection and handling of that information.
