				<h1>About SteveyMcGuy</h1>
				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>
					SteveyMcGuy (aka Joshua Wedgwood, or Bobscorn) is a small, passionate indie game developer, and programmer.
				</p>
				<h2>What do I do?</h2>
				<p>
					Currently making games. <br>
					Small indie games for now, but with a passion. <br>
					I don't like settling for copy-paste games, with exorbitant prices or smothered by ads. <br>
					We enjoy making special hand crafted games that are enjoyable to play.
				</p>
				<h2>What have I done?</h2>
				<p>
					I have spent the last few years doing a variety of programming. <br>
					In chronological order, this includes:
					<ul>
						<li>My own C++ Game Engine</li>
						<li><a href="https://steveymcguy.itch.io/totally-not-trump">A light-hearted Trump co-op game - Attack on Trumpocracy</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/Doublecouponday/vectorizer">A PNG/JPEG -> SVG image processor - Vectorizer</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BigBallsCo.Stacker">A 3D physics stacking Mobile Game - Piece Stacker 3D</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/Bobscorn/ptop">A Peer-to-peer UDP File Transfer Tool - PTOP</a></li>
					</ul>
					Previously I've spent 2.5 years making my own C++ game engine using SDL2, OpenGL, OpenAL and a few other libraries trying to do myself what all these triple AAA games were doing. <br>
					I was able to make a prototype game with this custom game engine, but not a completed product. <br>
					<br>
					I then tried out Unity and made a few games, namely Super Farm (my first game, likely to never see the light of day), Attack On Trumpocracy, and Piece Stacker 3D (aka Stacker). <br>
					<br>
					Otherwise I've been honing my general programming skills with various projects like <a href="https://github.com/Bobscorn/ptop">PTOP - a peer to peer file transfer program</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Doublecouponday/Vectorizer">Vectorizer - a PNG/JPG -> SVG image processor</a>
				</p>
				<h3>That's about it</h3>
				<p>
					If you want some more personal information, <br>
					Well I love video games, especially with friends. <br>
